/**
 * Once a week, deletes guests that can never come back (docs/PROJECT.md, 게스트 정리).
 * Firebase deletes anonymous accounts 30 days after they were created, but their user, room and
 * messages stay on the server. A guest is deleted here like an account deleted in the app
 * ({@link AccountService}): a partner keeps the room and the buddy.
 *
 * <p>Two conditions, so a guest is never deleted while still using the app: created more than 30
 * days ago (Firebase has deleted them by then), and not seen for a week (in case Firebase is late).
 * A guest who linked an account is no longer a guest from their next request on. Users from before
 * the guest flag existed are never cleaned up; there were only a few, during testing.
